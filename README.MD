# Welcome to my Sound Designer Portfolio 

Hi! I'm currently **learning web developpment** but my previous job was Sound Designer / Sound Engineer. I'm still doing freelancing from time to time and I want to build a portfolio website for it. So here is the code :)



# Files

I'll add each video / audio files and try to find a lighter solution with links and database

## Layout
- Still need to build the card animation, with video starting in it.
- Add a sound on/off button for the background video or put my signature music.
